# Spectral super-resolution 

The repository contains the proposed deep learning model for spectral reconstruction using only RGB bands.

# Dataset Download

The model is developed originally for spectral reconstruction on the LANDSAT-8 dataset which aims at predicting B5, B6, and B7 from only RGB bands. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
